Hey! I am currently a PhD student at the University of British Columbia (Vancouver), focusing on systems & control supervised by Professor [Ryozo Nagamune](https://mech.ubc.ca/ryozo-nagamune/). Before making my way here, I studied in the Netherlands at [TU Delft](https://www.tudelft.nl/en/) and worked as a reseracher at [Delft Center of System and Control](https://www.tudelft.nl/en/me/about/departments/delft-center-for-systems-and-control) under the supervision of Professor [Jan-Willem van Wingerden](https://www.janwillemvanwingerden.nl/). I am all about control theory, optimization, AI, robotics, and their application into the reality. And I am also always eager to learn something new!

# Fun Facts

- I walked 40 km from Rotterdam to The Hague for the charity event [Nacht van de Vluchteling](https://www.vluchteling.nl/hoe-jij-kunt-helpen/nacht-van-de-vluchteling) to support refugees.
- I have done a crazy roadtrip from Beijing to Tibet, and witnessed the peak of Mount Qomolangma (8848.86m) at the altitutde of 5200m. Easily one of the coolest things I’ve ever done.
- I did 300+ squats in a single day chasing runaway balls while volunteering at the China Science and Technology Museum, all while trying to explain gravity to a bunch of curious 5-year-olds. Let's just say... both my legs and my patience got a workout!
- Being a pilot has always been my dream.

# I Dream Of

- Meaningful relationships and a meaningful career.
